                <strong>SUCCESS</strong> is the part that matters the most.<br>
                Sleep comes at a cost...<br>
                Worth spending only when the fragments of your <strong>GOALS</strong>, are a step closer<br>
                Only then you know that the <strong>TIME</strong> was well spent<br>
                Enough to <strong>DREAM</strong> ahead and mark your success<br>

                I am from Bangalore, India. Well, originally from the North of India, to be specific: Delhi. However, I shifted <br>
                from Bangalore from 2nd grade onwards and had been there till I had to leave for University at the age of 18 years.<br>
                While I was in Bangalore 2 schools, Greenwood High (ICSE) and Canadian International School Bangalore (IB).<br>

                Currently, I am a student pursuing my bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science at RIT, NY. I am in my 3rd year now <br>
                and actively looking around for Summer, Fall and Spring Internships.
            </p>
            <p>
                So far, I have gotten into a few hackathons and 2 unpaid internships. Each have been really challenging for <br>
                me as the things that I learnt from there were new and helpful for my later assignments. Something like a ripple effect. <br>
                Learning work methods from courses, new languages from hackathons and new API implementations and use of libraries <br>
                from internships each have helped me from one assignment to another.
            </p>
            <p>
                Through this variety of experience, I was able to explore my curiosity in the fields that I worked on.

            <h2>Future..??</h2>
            <p>
                I look forward to deep dive into machine learning and deep learning.
