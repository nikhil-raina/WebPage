                <strong>SUCCESS</strong> is the part that matters the most.<br>
                Sleep comes at a cost...<br>
                Worth spending only when the fragments of your <strong>GOALS</strong>, are a step closer<br>
                Only then you know that the <strong>TIME</strong> was well spent<br>
                Enough to <strong>DREAM</strong> ahead and mark your success<br>

            <h2>Past</h2>
                <p>
                    I am from Bangalore, India. Well, originally from the North of India, to be specific: Delhi. However, I shifted <br>
                    from Bangalore from 2nd grade onwards and had been there till I had to leave for University at the age of 18 years.<br>
                    While I was in Bangalore 2 schools, Greenwood High (ICSE) and Canadian International School Bangalore (IB).<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    As far as I remember, I loved to fool around, play around, laugh about with friends and absolutely loved building Lego.<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The very concept of building and creating my own “Master Piece”, in a way at least, was far too entertaining for <br>
                    me to let go. Plus, at that age, children basically needed some good way to kill their time. I would usually do <br>
                    it by playing cricket, swimming, badminton, eating or just building things with Lego like: monuments, guns, robots,<br>
                    cars, bikes and buildings. As time went by, my mother and her sisters started to realize my passion and enjoyment <br>
                    towards “playing”, that’s what they would always say… such novice individuals, with Lego, I started to get more <br>
                    and more Lego puzzles. Each increasing in complexity. Eventually I was introduced to Mind Storm, which was a <br>
                    GAME CHANGER! <br><br>
                    Having been able to literally program your robot and make it move or sense or hold objects, was mind blowing to me!<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    I would always first follow the instructions to get used to building them, but eventually one main attribute stuck<br>
                    with me till date, from all the different kinds of Legos I came across. The need to break and recreate something<br>
                    better, at least that’s what I thought I was trying to do.<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    After making some robot of mine, I would take a picture of it and keep it aside, as a “momentary” satisfaction <br>
                    that I was able to build it by myself. Since I was getting many Lego puzzles, I had a decent abundance for the <br>
                    pieces, however after about 3 to 4 days, instead of looking at the new Lego puzzles, I would go back to the <br>
                    previous model and lose my satisfaction from it. So, I would reduce it a bit and try to modify it or just dismantle <br>
                    it completely and build it from scratch.<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    I believe that this was the introduction of my creativity and looking at things from a different perspective. <br>
                    This learning or realization started to get implemented, innately, in many other day to day chores and studies. <br>

                Currently, I am a student pursuing my bachelor’s degree in Computer Science at RIT, NY. I am in my 3rd year now <br>
                and actively looking around for Summer, Fall and Spring Internships.
            </p>
            <p>
                So far, I have gotten into a few hackathons and 2 unpaid internships. Each have been really challenging for <br>
                me as the things that I learnt from there were new and helpful for my later assignments. Something like a ripple effect. <br>
                Learning work methods from courses, new languages from hackathons and new API implementations and use of libraries <br>
                from internships each have helped me from one assignment to another.
            </p>
            <p>
                Through this variety of experience, I was able to explore my curiosity in the fields that I worked on.

            <h2>Future..??</h2>
            <p>
                I look forward to deep dive into machine learning and deep learning.
