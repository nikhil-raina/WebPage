                <strong>SUCCESS</strong> is the part that matters the most.<br>
                Sleep comes at a cost...<br>

                Only then you know that the <strong>TIME</strong> was well spent<br>
                Enough to <strong>DREAM</strong> ahead and mark your success<br>

            <h2>Past</h2>
                <p>
                    I am from Bangalore, India. Well, originally from the North of India, to be specific: Delhi. However, I shifted <br>
                    from Bangalore from 2nd grade onwards and had been there till I had to leave for University at the age of 18 years.<br>
                    While I was in Bangalore 2 schools, Greenwood High (ICSE) and Canadian International School Bangalore (IB).<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    As far as I remember, I loved to fool around, play around, laugh about with friends and absolutely loved building Lego.<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The very concept of building and creating my own “Master Piece”, in a way at least, was far too entertaining for <br>
                    me to let go. Plus, at that age, children basically needed some good way to kill their time. I would usually do <br>
                    it by playing cricket, swimming, badminton, eating or just building things with Lego like: monuments, guns, robots,<br>
                    cars, bikes and buildings. As time went by, my mother and her sisters started to realize my passion and enjoyment <br>
                    towards “playing”, that’s what they would always say… such novice individuals, with Lego, I started to get more <br>
                    and more Lego puzzles. Each increasing in complexity. Eventually I was introduced to Mind Storm, which was a <br>
                    GAME CHANGER! <br><br>
                    Having been able to literally program your robot and make it move or sense or hold objects, was mind blowing to me!<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    I would always first follow the instructions to get used to building them, but eventually one main attribute stuck<br>
                    with me till date, from all the different kinds of Legos I came across. The need to break and recreate something<br>
                    better, at least that’s what I thought I was trying to do.<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    After making some robot of mine, I would take a picture of it and keep it aside, as a “momentary” satisfaction <br>
                    that I was able to build it by myself. Since I was getting many Lego puzzles, I had a decent abundance for the <br>
                    pieces, however after about 3 to 4 days, instead of looking at the new Lego puzzles, I would go back to the <br>
                    previous model and lose my satisfaction from it. So, I would reduce it a bit and try to modify it or just dismantle <br>
                    it completely and build it from scratch.<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    I believe that this was the introduction of my creativity and looking at things from a different perspective. <br>
                    This learning or realization started to get implemented, innately, in many other day to day chores and studies. <br>

            <h2>Present</h2>
            <p>
                After completing my IB curriculum, I got selected and eventually enrolled in RIT at Rochester, New York.<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                Right now, I am a 3rd year student pursuing my major in Computer Science with a double minor: Software <br>
                Engineering and Mathematics.<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                <h3 class="present heading">Why Mathematics?</h3>
                    I really wasn’t looking forward to deep dive into Mathematics, however, after coming to the University, <br>
                    getting taught by few excellent professors, especially Adam Towsly, not only my understanding for the <br>
                    subject moved exponentially, but it also made me think to and eventually go forward with taking Math as a <br>
                    minor as well.<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                <h3 class="present heading">Why Software Engineering?</h3>
                    Since I am already in the Computer Science major, it only made sense for me to look at my growth and <br>
                    understanding in terms of Software Development or Software Engineering. I wanted to have the knowledge behind <br>
                    the IDEs I am writing my programs along with the data-structures I was dealing with to thoroughly understand <br>
                    the implementation of each one of them. This knowledge was being absorbed through my rigorous and fast paced <br>
                    course under the CS major. Next, I needed was the extensive APIs and frameworks that are implemented into <br>
                    programs. This is now being achieved by choosing to take Software Engineering as my second major.<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                <h3 class="present heading">What about you courses?</h3>
                    Well, I have gone through a good amount of courses so far in my University life. Few of which are <br>
                    mentioned in the <a href="academics.html">Academics</a>Category
                    Through this variety of experience, I was able to explore my curiosity in the fields that I worked on.<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                <h3 class="present heading">What am I doing now?</h3>
                <p>
                    At the moment, I am actively looking for Spring and Summer internships to further my growth and <br>
                    learning in my field.<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Other than my study choices, I have also taken part in a few Hackathons under the <a href="projects.html">Projects</a><br>
                    Category. Over there, you will also be shown projects that I did while I was working in my <br>
                    internships that I was able to get during the winter vacations in 2017 and the summer vacations of 2018.<br>

            <p>
                I look forward to deep dive into machine learning and deep learning.
