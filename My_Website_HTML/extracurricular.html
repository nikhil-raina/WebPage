            <h2 class="extracurricular-sub-category">cricket</h2>
                <p>
                    From 5th till the 12th grade I used to play cricket. It eventually became my favorite sport.
                    I first joined the Fronteirs Group for Cricket Coaching when I recently joined the 8th grade. I was
                    there for 2 years during which I started to perfect my basics and to focus on my primary strength,
                    batting. As time went by, so did our practice. Eventually the coaching center organized their
                    annual tournaments and this time I was selected as the captain of my team. There were 6 teams in
                    total. After the end of the tournament, we stood second place.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was awarded as the best captain of the tournament.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From 11th till 12th grade, I then moved to a more recognized coaching center called KIOC
                    (Karnataka Institute of Cricket). Here I truly felt the challenge among my peers as each was
                    excellent in the primary skill. This put me back in the order again. However, I worked hard here
                    as well, strengthening my batting and my bowling skills. I preferred being a spinner when it would
                    come to bowling. From my progression, this time I was selected as the Vice-Captain of my team.
                    During our matches, we lost in the quarter finals itself and stood 4th. Despite of losing, we had
                    one best team play, best bowler and best batsman of the tournament.
                </p>
            <h2 class="extracurricular-sub-category">MMA</h2>
                <p>
                    I decided to get enrolled into MMA coaching from 10th to 12th mainly to work on my physique as I
                    had become rather obese. The initial training was just self-defense, which was a 1-week course.
                    However, I was able to finish the course on my first day itself. At that time, my coach saw my
                    learning curve and the ability to pick up the style quickly that he wished to teach me proper MMA.
                    The following day till 3 weeks, every day for 2 and a half hours, I was given strict core and
                    fitness training to acclimate myself to the rigor of the environment. I was the youngest “fighter”
                    among all the people. Finally, after my fitness training, I was thought MMA, starting with Boxing,
                    for the hands, Muay Thai for the legs and ending with Brazilian Jiu Jitsu for the grappling. I
                    picked up the grappling moves quickly, and it eventually became my best asset.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each sparring session I attended, I was made to fight with guys bigger and stronger than me. It
                    truly was brutal as I had, for the first time in my life, felt what it meant to be “manhandled”.
                    I lost almost all my matches and then I would get trained again. After many tries, injuries, and
                    bleeding as well, I was finally able to take down each and everyone of my opponents. There were 6
                    of them in total and it took me more than 4 months to take all of them down as each specialized in
                    a particular style. After this, my coach offered me an opportunity to fight officially in the
                    octagon. He told me “from the beginning, I realized that you have raw talent. I wanted to see how
                    sharp you could get.” I said yes to this chance and fought in the Octagon 4 times. I lost the 4th
                    fight of mine. Sadly, that was the end for my “professional” fighting as my grandparents didn’t
                    allow me further. However I still practiced to maintain my training.
                </p>
            <h2 class="extracurricular-sub-category">swimming</h2>
                <p>
                    I started to swim from a very young age. My most favorable stroke was freestyle followed by
                    backstroke and then Breast stroke. I didn’t know how to do butterfly properly as I could never
                    maintain the hand to leg coordination. I was in my Greenwood school team for 3 years. During which,
                    I won 3 gold medals, 1 silver medal and 1 bronze medal for backstroke; and 2 gold medals and
                    1 bronze medal for freestyle.

                </p>
                    <h2 class="extracurricular-sub-category">badminton</h2>
                <p>
                    This was more of my “pleasure” sport. I started to play it from the 8th grade. I was trained by my
                    cousin brother, who at that time was a state level player in badminton. The main reason he trained
                    me was so that he would have someone to play with whenever he would come to visit me. I found that
                    to be a very demeaning reason, but I still learnt from him and eventually ended up beating him in a
                    few games as well. Later, badminton became a great passion and hobby for me. It didn’t require that
                    many people and it would exhaust me enough so that I could eat my food properly. Eventually I
                    started to improve my play by myself and observing other people who were and are better than me.
                    I too, slowly, improved my play.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I then took part in local competitions held by a group of localities. I used to play under 27-year
                    category as that was truly challenging and fun. I came 3rd and second many times, but only came 1st
                    once. All those wins and losses made me realizes that I had that much more to improve on, and so I
                    kept on doing my best to improve myself.

        <h1 class="extracurricular-main-category">on campus clubs</h1>
            <h2 class="extracurricular-sub-category">habitat for humanity</h2>
                <p>
                    This is a Student led club. I was enrolled in this club from during my 12th grade. This club or
                    non-profit organisation brings people, around the world, to build homes, communities promoting
                    welfare for the unfortunate and eventually raising hope for everyone on this planet. This club has
                    been running in my school for past 8 years during which, there have been several events and outdoor
                    activities where in, we students, have made the initiative to bring about a change in the community.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was appointed as the event organiser in the board of members. I was responsible for finding and
                    organising events where the club would be able to offer their help and make small changes within
                    the society. I had conducted over 4 events followed by personal hands-on work during the events to
                    facilitate the teamwork and ensure that the given work was completed within the given time. Most of
                    our events were regarding building houses. On the building site, we would be separated in teams,
                    where each team was designated with one or two specific chores that lasted about 6 to 7 hours.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was also recommended and awarded as the best leader 2 times for the events.

            <h2 class="extracurricular-sub-category">oasis</h2>
                <p>
                    A student led Club. I joined this club during the starting of my second year in the University.<br>
                    OASIS is a non-profit cultural organization which stands for Organization for the Alliance of
                    Students from the Indian Subcontinent. We showcase the culture by hosting events and generating
                    funds for it through food share and table sitting events.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was appointed as the Head of Sales team, which managed gathering funds for the events.
                    We hosted multiple table sitting events where in we would have food share and other small
                    activities that would represent our Indian Culture such as; Chai and Mehndi drawing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During the Middle of the Second year, I was appointed as the Vice-President of Oasis. My first
                    order of business was to host an event called Holi, a Hindu Spring festival which is also known as
                    the “festival of colors”. Despite of having just about a week for the entire preparation, it was a
                    huge success having almost 90 people being gathered for the event. The event went on for 5 hours.
                </p>
            <h2 class="extracurricular-sub-category">chess</h2>
                <p>
                    I joined the chess club when i was in the 6th grade and was there for 3 years. I started from
                    scratch by being at the very last table and slowly made my way by winning all the games I played
                    and learnt as much as I could from the ones where I lost. Soon, I got selected to play for my house
                    color (within same school groups competition) and for the inter-school competition as well. Our
                    house had won the tournament 2 years in a row. Our school won the inter-school championships
                    3 years in a row. I was given the medal for the quickest win, only making 4 moves.

            <h2 class="extracurricular-sub-category">little school helpers</h2>
                <p>
                    I was enrolled in the club during my 11th grade. This club was built in order to help out teachers
                    in the lower grades with their require work. It could be crafting, teaching math, spending time
                    with children or checking the children’s assignments. I really enjoyed this club as I had a great
                    time spending with the children. From here I realised that I like to spend time with children and
                    that I can actually end up handling them quite well as well. In a strange way, I could relate to
                    the work the children would be doing or would want to do, as a result, I would already be prepared
                    in order to help them out in any way possible. Then, of course, helping the teachers was also
                    really entertaining but highly time consuming as that demanded a proper distribution of the labour
                    and coordinated workflow. In time, we managed to get that working as well as a well oiled machine.
                    This was probably the first time I had a proper practical experience with teamwork that ended up
                    working extremely well.

            <h2 class="extracurricular-sub-category">bhumi</h2>
                <p>
                    Bhumi is one of India's largest independent youth volunteer non-profit organisations. Bhumi as a
                    platform enables over 12,000 volunteers in more than 12 cities across India for causes like
                    education, environment, animals, community welfare etc. I was enrolled in this organisation for
                    2 years, from the 10th grade till the 12th grade.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I taught math to the children. This was a really difficult part as the students weren’t cooperative
                    at all. It took me a long time, however, I started to understand how to actually teach. I finally
                    realised that the best way to teach a student is to be able to mold yourself the way the student
                    would be able to understand it. I slowly started to understand this method and eventually became
                    really comfortable to teach the. I taught them simple math functions such as addition, subtraction,
                    multiplication and division.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Other than this work, Bhumi also hosted a Nationwide event called Nakshatra, which basically
                    provided a means of a platform for children from the entire nation to showcase their talent. I was
                    selected as the assistant in the sales and marketing category. We were responsible to spread
                    awareness about the event and to gather funds. My team was able to make the highest funds even by
                    just 3 people which went to 30000 rupees. The event lasted for the entire day. It was a huge
                    success. About 3000 people showed up for it.
