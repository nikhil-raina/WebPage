                                A POS Billing System is a combination of software and hardware that allows merchants to
                                take transactions and simplify key day-to-day business operations. <br>
                                During my IB School life, my Computer Science related project was to make a POS Billing system.
                                I made use of JAVA, JAVA Swing, Photoshop and MySql to finish this project.<br>
                                I had decided to make the retails company, Nilgiris, in my locality as my client for the
                                project.
                            </p>
                        </div>

                                After analysing their system and having a one-on-one discussion with the manager,
                                I found out that their product was extremely outdated, slow, had no means of employee
                                validation or verification and no Sign in safety. So, my approach to this project was like
                                an "upgrade" to the old system that try to match all the new requirements of the Client.<br>
                                At the start of the product, I tried to make the entire User Experience as simple and
                                interactive as possible. <br>
                                I came up with 3 buttons. Out of which, 2 were designated for employees of the of the company
                                and the other was to register a new employee.

                                that particular employee will be given a specific ID number that acts as a second degree
                                verification for the system.

                                This is specific to the Employees only. There are multiple details that have to be entered by
                                the employee in order for them to have an account in the system. This method further improves
                                the security of the system and plays an important role while trying to retrieve the password when
                                forgotten. The picture next to the details was taken before the registration began by the
                                employee. I wasn't able to access the camera API during that time.

                                This was the main "selling page" of the product. I tried to make this layout as employee
                                friendly as possible. This included a feature to allow multiple removal of item by selecting
                                them on the table. Each product's cost and discount prices were kept up-to date by the manager
                                of that branch. They were refreshed every week. Only the manager had access to the costing
                                of each product.<br>
                                In the end, a bill was also produced having the date and time of the purchase, name of
                                customer, name of employee doing your purchase, the items and their costs and any additional
                                costs such as tax. There was also contact information in the bill in order to contact the
                                store.

                                For my course in JAVA, CSCI142, we were required to make a 2 man project called Path Builder.<br>
                                It was essentially a GUI based game, similar to the game <a target="_blank" href="http://dotsgame.co/">Dots And Boxes</a> but just
                                without the boxes. Instead, the lines were supposed to go from North to South or East to West.<br>
                                It was a two player game. One player would for its set of lines from North to South while the other
                                would focus on making the lines from East to West.<br>
                                We were already given a pre-coded set that consisted of the GUI. However, we were responsible to make
                                the functioning part, that is the backend of the program. My team implemented the Dijkshtra's Algorithm.

                                    During the winter of 2017, I was able to get an unpaid internship to a start-up company called Tapplent Inc.<br>
                                    For this internship, I was given an assignment where I was supposed to create a similar messaging interface as WhatsApp. This was the first
                                    time I was introduced to Restful API calls, such as GET and SET. I used the PostMan application to view all the JSON data. I completed this
                                    assignment by making use of JAVA, for the backend part, and XML, for the frontend part. I use Android Studio as my IDE.

                                    This was the layout that I made for per person. The way it would be appearing for each person, if
                                    the messaging is only between 2 people, that is one-on-one.
                                </p>

                                    This layout enabled the user to select the number of people and the people itself to be
                                    part of the group. On the right hand side, all the possible members in the contact list
                                    would appear. By doing a long-press on each individual name, it would get selected. To deselect
                                    them, they would just have to be pressed again. After selecting the number of people to be part of the
                                    group text, the 'Group' button would be pressed that would then create the group and lead to the
                                    <a href="#content_a3">Set Group</a> layout.
                                </p>

                                    This layout would just give a name to the group that would be created by the individual. This
                                    name would appear on each member's screen if they are part of this group. The 'send' button would then just finalise
                                    the group members and the name.

                                            The data was formatted with a cluster of nested dictionaries and nested lists.<br>
                                            The unit_questions_data() would be called by the getData() when it had to retrieve each assessment Org_Unit_Question data.<br>
                                            The get_graph_data() got the each graph specific data with the help of the Survey_ID of each assessment.
                                            The heat_map_data() got all the data from the Unit_Questions API, further into the Reports section, in order to
                                            generate Heat Maps for the Org_Unit_Questions and the category based Org_Unit_Questions as well.
                                            The getSurvey_ID was responsible to get the survey ID of a specific assessment.

                                            A Heat Map is just a form of data representation where the data is represented through a diagram.
                                            In the diagram, the vales are usually shown through colours indicating their value by having a legend to
                                            describe the quantitative values of the data.<br>
                                            This was my first project for this internship.<br>
                                            I used Python and libraries such as Matplotlib, Pandas and Seaborn to achieve the given results.

                                            I created 2 functions that allowed me to create the Heat Map. One function is responsible to make the
                                            category based Heat Map, that is the Heat Map with all the org_unit_questions. Whereas the other function
                                            will make a more specific, a sub categorised Heat Map that would essentially be a Heat Map of the questions under
                                            each category, which is the org_unit_questions. Thus their parameters are different as well.

                                            This one one among many other org_unit_question related Heat Maps. The x-axis and they-axis are
                                            also labeled. The heading depends on the type of Heat Map that has been requested to generated. For the
                                            org_unit_question, the heading would be 'Categorical Heat Map' whereas for specific categories, in the org_unit_questions,
                                            it would be that question as the heading.

                            <div class="content-intro">
                                <p>
                                    This was my 3rd Hackathon and by far the most productive one I had been to.<br>
                                    For this Hackathon, my team and I decided to make an Android App called <a href="https://github.com/nxr5013/Where2" target="_blank">Where2</a>.<br>
                                    The main concept of this App was that it would give the user periodic notifications, the period is decided by the user upon starting the app. The notifications
                                    would be about functions, concerts or events that might be occurring around the user's current location, in future to a possible 1 or 2 months or that would be occurring then and there itself.
                                    The idea was that the user is always up-to date with his or her preferences without missing as little as possible in the real time.<br>
                                    To achieve this, we made use of JAVA, XML and TicketMaster as our events based API.
                                </p>
                            </div>

                            <div class="image-box" id="image_c1">
                                <img src="../My_Website_images/project screenshots/Where2/loginScreen.png" height="570"
                                     width="658"/>
                            </div>
                            <div class="content-box" id="content_c1">
                                <p>
                                    This is the Login Screen. Our idea was to make specific accounts to maintain the uniqueness of each person's preference, however, since we had a limited amount
                                    of time in our hands. We didnt create that. Instead we jumped to the next main screen. Here the user enter's his or her zip-code, or any place's zip-code, in america.
                                    This is the starting of the personalisation of the user. After all the steps are done, our idea was to allow the user to have a choices whether or not
                                    to have the app access his or her GPS location, to give the notifications from wherever the user is. But, that can get a little bothersome, so we decided
                                    to let the user decide that on their own.
                                </p>
                            </div>

                                <p>
                                    This is the Preference Screen. According to the zip-code, entered by the user, the backend would then narrow down all the possible categories that our related to
                                    that particular zip-code. After doing this, it would relay them on the screen, as in this layout, with the sub-categories of the main titles. By simply checking them
                                    would then increase the preferences of the user. The date section at the bottom, would further narrow down the events or functions occurring that day itself. This
                                    was introduced mainly to cater the question "What if I, the user, am trying to find out events on a specific day?"
                                </p>

                                    After deciding on the preferences, the user would be directed to the List of Preference related items, which would then give out the details of the functions or events that would be
                                    happening during that period. <br>
                                    Currently we only supported a single selection option fot the items.

                                    This is the Per Item screen, catering specifically to a concert. Our idea was to have a uniques set of layouts for all possible categories that their might be in order
                                    to give the user a more rich and grabbing experience, instead of making it monotonic and simple. <br>
                                    The more detailed information is given on this layout, pertaining to the concert.

                                    While working at my second internship, the work I was given hod a good content of frontend development. This finally gave me the opportunity to make an effort at least, to make
                                    my website, which I have been wanting to make for about a year. So, I guess better later than Never.<br>
                                    I made use of HTML, CSS and JS.

                                    For this website, I haven't worked on it intensively. As a result, I haven't made it dynamic like most of the popular and highly attracting websites. However, I have tried to
                                    make it as interesting as I could. I will further continue to add in more details and make changes to the appearance in future developments.<br>
                                    Currently, I hope that you have liked the presentation of the website, but don't worry. This is not only a way to view my resume in a more interactive manner, but to also get to know me more
                                    better, my personality, my adventures, my quirks, my drawbacks and me as a person. I hope that I have tried to be as descriptive as I have. If not, then don't worry again. <br>
                                    There is much more to be written and shown.
