                                A POS Billing System is a combination of software and hardware that allows merchants to
                                take transactions and simplify key day-to-day business operations. <br>
                                During my IB School life, my Computer Science related project was to make a POS Billing system.
                                I made use of JAVA, JAVA Swing, Photoshop and MySql to finish this project.<br>
                                I had decided to make the retails company, Nilgiris, in my locality as my client for the
                                project.
                            </p>
                        </div>

                                After analysing their system and having a one-on-one discussion with the manager,
                                I found out that their product was extremely outdated, slow, had no means of employee
                                validation or verification and no Sign in safety. So, my approach to this project was like
                                an "upgrade" to the old system that try to match all the new requirements of the Client.<br>
                                At the start of the product, I tried to make the entire User Experience as simple and
                                interactive as possible. <br>
                                I came up with 3 buttons. Out of which, 2 were designated for employees of the of the company
                                and the other was to register a new employee.

                                that particular employee will be given a specific ID number that acts as a second degree
                                verification for the system.

                                This is specific to the Employees only. There are multiple details that have to be entered by
                                the employee in order for them to have an account in the system. This method further improves
                                the security of the system and plays an important role while trying to retrieve the password when
                                forgotten. The picture next to the details was taken before the registration began by the
                                employee. I wasn't able to access the camera API during that time.

                                This was the main "selling page" of the product. I tried to make this layout as employee
                                friendly as possible. This included a feature to allow multiple removal of item by selecting
                                them on the table. Each product's cost and discount prices were kept up-to date by the manager
                                of that branch. They were refreshed every week. Only the manager had access to the costing
                                of each product.<br>
                                In the end, a bill was also produced having the date and time of the purchase, name of
                                customer, name of employee doing your purchase, the items and their costs and any additional
                                costs such as tax. There was also contact information in the bill in order to contact the
                                store.

                                For my course in JAVA, CSCI142, we were required to make a 2 man project called Path Builder.<br>
                                It was essentially a GUI based game, similar to the game <a target="_blank" href="http://dotsgame.co/">Dots And Boxes</a> but just
                                without the boxes. Instead, the lines were supposed to go from North to South or East to West.<br>
                                It was a two player game. One player would for its set of lines from North to South while the other
                                would focus on making the lines from East to West.<br>
                                We were already given a pre-coded set that consisted of the GUI. However, we were responsible to make
                                the functioning part, that is the backend of the program. My team implemented the Dijkshtra's Algorithm.

                                    During the winter of 2017, I was able to get an unpaid internship to a start-up company called Tapplent Inc.<br>
                                    For this internship, I was given an assignment where I was supposed to create a similar messaging interface as WhatsApp. This was the first
                                    time I was introduced to Restful API calls, such as GET and SET. I used the PostMan application to view all the JSON data. I completed this
                                    assignment by making use of JAVA, for the backend part, and XML, for the frontend part. I use Android Studio as my IDE.

                                    This was the layout that I made for per person. The way it would be appearing for each person, if
                                    the messaging is only between 2 people, that is one-on-one.
                                </p>

                                    This layout enabled the user to select the number of people and the people itself to be
                                    part of the group. On the right hand side, all the possible members in the contact list
                                    would appear. By doing a long-press on each individual name, it would get selected. To deselect
                                    them, they would just have to be pressed again. After selecting the number of people to be part of the
                                    group text, the 'Group' button would be pressed that would then create the group and lead to the
                                    <a href="#content_a3">Set Group</a> layout.
                                </p>

                                    This layout would just give a name to the group that would be created by the individual. This
                                    name would appear on each member's screen if they are part of this group. The 'send' button would then just finalise
                                    the group members and the name.

                                            The data was formatted with a cluster of nested dictionaries and nested lists.<br>
                                            The unit_questions_data() would be called by the getData() when it had to retrieve each assessment Org_Unit_Question data.<br>
                                            The get_graph_data() got the each graph specific data with the help of the Survey_ID of each assessment.
                                            The heat_map_data() got all the data from the Unit_Questions API, further into the Reports section, in order to
                                            generate Heat Maps for the Org_Unit_Questions and the category based Org_Unit_Questions as well.
                                            The getSurvey_ID was responsible to get the survey ID of a specific assessment.
