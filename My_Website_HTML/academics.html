            Below are a few course I have taken during my University life that I believe are important for my progress
            in my desired developing Field.
        </h1>

        <h2 class="academics-category">Python</h2>
            <p class="academics-category-content">
                Course serves as an introduction to computational thinking using a problem-centered approach.
                Specific topics covered include: expression of algorithms in pseudocode and a programming language;
                functional and imperative programming techniques; control structures; problem solving using recursion;
                basic searching and sorting; elementary data structures such as lists, trees, and graphs; and
                correctness, testing and debugging. Assignments (both in class and for homework) requiring a pseudo
                code solution and an implementation are an integral part of the course.<br>
                An end-of-term project is also required.

        </p>


        <h2 class="academics-category">JAVA</h2>
            <p class="academics-category-content">
                Course dives further into problem solving by continuing the discussion of data structure use and design,
                but now from an object-oriented perspective. Key topics include more information on tree and graph
                structures, nested data structures, objects, classes, inheritance, interfaces, object-oriented
                collection class libraries for abstract data types (e.g. stacks, queues, maps, and trees), and static
                vs. dynamic data types. Concepts of object-oriented design are a large part of the course. Software
                qualities related to object orientation, namely cohesion, minimal coupling, modifiability, and
                extensibility, are all introduced in this course, as well as a few elementary object-oriented design
                patterns. Input and output streams, graphical user interfaces, and exception handling are covered.
                Students will also be introduced to a modern integrated software development environment (IDE).<br>
                Programming projects will be required.
            </p>


        <h2 class="academics-category">C Programming</h2>
            <p class="academics-category-content">
                Deeper introduction to the details of program structure and the mechanics of execution as well as
                supportive operating system features. Security and performance issues in program design will be
                discussed. The program translation process will be examined. <br>
                Programming assignments will be required.
            </p>


        <h2 class="academics-category">Software Engineering</h2>
            <p class="academics-category-content">
                An introductory course in software engineering, emphasizing the organizational aspects of software
                development and software design and implementation by individuals and small teams within a
                process/product framework. Topics include the software lifecycle, software design, user interface
                issues, specification and implementation of components, assessing design quality, design reviews and
                code inspections, software testing, basic support tools, technical communications and system
                documentation, team-based development. <br>
                A term-long, team-based project done in a studio format is used to reinforce concepts presented in
                class.
            </p>


        <h2 class="academics-category">Linear Algebra</h2>
            <p class="academics-category-content">
                This course is an introduction to the basic concepts of linear algebra, and techniques of matrix
                manipulation. Topics include linear transformations, Gaussian elimination, matrix arithmetic,
                determinants, vector spaces, linear independence, basis, null space, row space, and column space of a
                matrix, eigenvalues, eigenvectors, change of basis, similarity and diagonalization. Various
                applications are studied throughout the course.
            </p>


        <h2 class="academics-category">Discrete Mathematics for computing</h2>
            <p class="academics-category-content">
                This course introduces students to ideas and techniques from discrete mathematics that are widely used
                in Computer Science. Students will learn about the fundamentals of propositional and predicate
                calculus, set theory, relations, recursive structures and counting. This course will help increase
                studentsâ€™ mathematical sophistication and their ability to handle abstract problems.

            </p>


        <h2 class="academics-category">probability and statistics</h2>
            <p class="academics-category-content">
                This course introduces sample spaces and events, axioms of probability, counting techniques,
                conditional probability and independence, distributions of discrete and continuous random variables,
                joint distributions (discrete and continuous), the central limit theorem, descriptive statistics,
                interval estimation, and applications of probability and statistics to real-world problems.
                A statistical package such as Minitab or R is used for data analysis and statistical applications.

            </p>

        <h2 class="academics-category">intro to computer science theory</h2>
            <p class="academics-category-content">
                This course provides an introduction to the theory of computation, including formal languages,
                grammars, auto-mata theory, computability, and complexity.
